# Guided Project: Predicting Bike Rentals

In the United States, many cities have bike sharing systems in place. One such city is Washington D.C., and in this project, I attempt to predict the total number of bikes people rented in a given hour. To accomplish this task, I explore several machine learning techniques to determine an effective prediction model. The techniques used in this project include the linear regression, decision tree, and random forest.
